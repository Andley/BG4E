“John fell in the river,  
got very cold,  
and had two large whiskies.

As Toolan points out, if these clauses are rearranged, the ‘story’ changes radically:

John had two large whiskies,  
fell in the river,  
and got very cold.

Although the individual clauses are still the same, the meaning of two of them has changed as their textual context has changed (assuming that the reader has drawn some fairly standard inferences about alcohol).”
