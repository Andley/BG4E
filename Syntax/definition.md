>"The difference is that the epexegetical infinitive explains the noun or adjective to which it is related, while apposition defines it. That is to say, apposition differs from epexegesis in that an appositional infinitive is more substantival than adjectival. This subtle difference can be seen in another way: An epexegetical infinitive (phrase) cannot typically substitute for its antecedent, while an appositional infinitive (phrase) can."

> "Apposition: a semantic relationship whereby one item (a word, phrase or even clause) defines another. Apposition in Greek may be established through a variety of means, including an appositional genitive, appositional nominative, appositional accusative, and the use of the infinitive. An appositional relationship is sometimes distinguished from an epexegetical one, with apposition expressing a relationship for nouns and epexegesis for verbs."

>"Epexegetic: a semantic relationship whereby one item (a word, phrase or even clause) defines another (also known as apposition). An epexegetic relation in Greek may be established through a variety of means, including an epexegetical genitive, epexegetical nominative, epexegetical accusative, and the use of the infinitive. This use is often distinguished from apposition, with epexegesis expressing a relationship for verbs and apposition for nouns."

> "apposition is a NOUN function that expands the head noun with further naming or identifying information, while attribution is an ADJECTIVE function that expands the head noun with descriptive information."

>I use the term as a technical term for a syntactical usage requires the word in question to be an event word (a verb introduced by a conjunction, and infinitive, or an event noun) that offers specifying or explanatory information about another word, which itself is also often an event, but is sometimes a noun or adjective that requires an action-type adjunct to identify it more fully. The event word is not a COMPLEMENT, though; it does not answer a simple "who or what?" question to complete a verb. The reason I did not include the participle in the list of specific event words above is that I'm not aware of the participle functioning quite this way.
Some examples, with the epexegetical word shown in all caps, would be:
Hurry TO COME to me before winter.
They would have had opportunity TO RETURN.
I have need TO BE BAPTIZED by you.
He is worthy OF DEATH.
Did you receive the Spirit . . . by the hearing OF FAITH?""
